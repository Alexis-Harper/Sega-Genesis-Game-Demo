# Sega Genesis Game Demo (by Alexis Harper)

I wanted to try and make something cool in asm, and an old game console seemed like a cool way to do it, so I just wanted to create a simple game of some kind for Sega Genesis after watching the Computerphile video on it and with 68k asm having the best syntax and features.

I creaated all assets myself, and all code past following the tutorials on [Big Evil Corporation](https://blog.bigevilcorporation.co.uk/2012/02/28/sega-megadrive-1-getting-started/) and [HuguesJohnson.com](https://huguesjohnson.com/programming/genesis/palettes/) to learn the basics.

Feel free to steal/use any of the code or assets used in this game, or to correct me on anything in it.
